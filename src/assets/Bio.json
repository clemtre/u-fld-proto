It is an imaginary place, a sort of receptacle for our creative and technical ideas. Inspired by crafters and fine arts, we always try to find a balance between aesthetics and techniques, while experimenting with the tools. We have a deep interest in creating realistic details that take place in atmospheres inspired by surrealism or magic realism art movements.</p>\n<p>Specialized in 3D technologies, our transversal and multidisciplinary approach is based on the varied skills of the team (storyboarding, avatar creation, cloth, environment modeling, texturing and sound design...). This allows us to adapt ourselves to a wide panel of tasks for the clients coming from fashion to performing arts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\"Carried by their kites, <em> Les Ronciers </em> scan the horizon, looking for unexplored fields\"</p>","ville":"Lyon","mail":"contact@unexploredfields.com","tel":"+33 6 48 74 08 39","insta":"https://www.instagram.com/unexplored_fields/","linkedin":null}}
